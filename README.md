Step 1. Open 2 terminals and in each cd into the project folder. --> i.e. cd Desktop/Databases-Final

Step 2. In one of the terminals, cd into the frontend folder --> i.e. cd frontend

Step 3. Run npm install 

Step 4. In the other terminal, cd into the backend folder

Step 5. Again, run npm install

Step 6. In both terminals, run npm start (its better to run the backend first!) 

At this point, you have successfully started the application and a window directing
you to localhost:3000 will open up.

From here, you just need to sign up and create an account. After signing up you can
log into the application and explore differents artists/events, learn, and save
artists for future reference/recommendations.
